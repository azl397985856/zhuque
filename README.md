## Introduction
Dashboard to show error and performance log integrated with security and persistence. How to collect the error log and performance log easily? perhaps on its way.

## Usage
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
And open http://127.0.0.1:1024/webpack-dev-server/index.html
before getting started, you should visit /login with {name: 'lzp', password: 'lzp'}, try /logout to logout. cause I'm prepared for logging with 3rd party login server. if you'r intersted with it, follow my account for the latest news
