## Introduction
Dashboard to show error and performance log integrated with security and persistence. There will be four **MIT** to do,
collect, storeï¼Œprocess and alarm. so what I do is store and process, the alarm is under consideration. and if you want
to collect data from the clients, try using the [zhuque-client](https://github.com/azl397985856/zhuque-client).

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```
And open http://127.0.0.1:1024/webpack-dev-server/index.html
before getting started, you should visit /login with {name: 'lzp', password: 'lzp'}, try /logout to logout. cause I'm prepared for logging with 3rd party login server. if you'r intersted with it, follow my account for the latest news
